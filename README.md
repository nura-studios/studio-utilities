#### Fast Approval Workflow with MPV

MPV is an open source media player that can look at images, audio and video. We've customized it so that there are specialized hotkeys for cycling through media files quickly using the up and down arrow keyboard shortcuts. When you have found an image, video, or audio that you like press the "s" key to make a select. If the currently viewed file has "_attempt_##" in the name, MPV will copy the currently displayed media file with the attempt suffix removed from the filename. The presence of this file will mark it as an approved asset and it will no longer be regenerated during the regeneration process. This means that if you wish to un-approve something, just delete the file with the delete key and the next regeneration will see that no select has been made and will regenerate new attempts for review.

### üé® Artist-Friendly Customizations

## üîß Customization

### MPV Customization

#### Adding File Extensions

Edit the `media_extensions` table in the script to support additional formats:

```lua
local media_extensions = {
    image = {".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".webp", ".tiff", ".tga", ".psd"},
    video = {".mp4", ".avi", ".mkv", ".mov", ".wmv", ".flv", ".webm", ".m4v"},
    audio = {".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".ogg", ".aac", ".m4a", ".wma"}
}
```

#### Modifying Hotkeys

The script uses standard MPV key binding syntax. Modify the bindings at the bottom of the script file.

### Photoshop Script Customization

#### Document Size

Modify the document dimensions in the script:

```javascript
var doc = app.documents.add(2048, 2048, 72, docName);
```

#### Keywords and Layout

Edit the keywords array and positioning logic to customize layout:

```javascript
var keywords = ["front", "back", "left", "right", "hero"];
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MPV Issues

**Mouse wheel not working correctly:**
